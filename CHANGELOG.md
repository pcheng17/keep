## v1.0.0 - 2024-12-30

Initial release, with the following features:

- Given a `data.json` file which contains urls that I'd like to save along with a description, `keep` will generate a simple webpage that displays the information.
- Entries are grouped by week, and entries ordered in reverse chronological order, i.e., the farther down you go, the older the links are in terms of when I saved them.
